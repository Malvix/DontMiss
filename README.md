DontMiss
========

A small theos tweak that removes the 'Missed' tab from iOS 7's notification center.

It's should to be easy to understand, hence the detailed comments (at least I think they are :D) and is intended
for beginners.

Compatibility

It was tested on an iPhone 5 running iOS 7.0.4 and should NOW work on
a 64-Bit device as well.
