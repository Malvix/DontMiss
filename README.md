DontMiss
========

A small theos tweak that removes the 'Missed' tab from iOS 7's notification center.

It's should to be easy to understand, hence the detailed comments (at least I think they are :D) and is intended
for beginners.

Compatibility
=============
It was tested on an iPhone 5 running iOS 7.0.4 and should not work on a firmware < 7.x or
a 64-Bit device as it depends on Mobile Substrate.
